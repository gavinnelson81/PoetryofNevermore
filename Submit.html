		<h2>Clock Gears</h2>
	<p>For over two thousand years people work like gears in a big clock always talking the talk but never walking the walk. Some gears are big some are small but they all work together to make the clock call. Once in awhile a gear needs replaced and when society gives tests most gears aced. I am a small gear but I’m growing and like a star I am glowing. In the years to come I will make my mark, it may not be big and it might not be small but it’s there for everyone and all.
	<br><br>Time is ticking by and I’m a guy listening for a reason why I can't do more for people to hear the tick, tock, tick, tock of life. Every society is a clock with gods or a god as the grand carpenter, with some as fierce as a lion and some as gentle as a caterpillar. Some gears start small but grow with experience to be the biggest gears of all. People judge others on what they can do, what they like, and what they are, saying they will never amount to anything more than just a person that will make them fall asleep and snore, saying you will always be a small gear.
	<br><br>I have only been alive a small time but I know how to get a point across and that’s through a rhyme in a poem that chimes from a clock that this gear is from. At this point in time people get in line to fight for the right to be the biggest gear of all time but the fight is lost to the creator of the clock, the carpenters win because they lock you into place, they lock you into your place. For the next few thousand years and beyond things will change, for better or worse I’m not sure but I hope I never have to shed any tears. We are all clock gears and we can’t change that so I think it’s time to relax and let out all your rage at the end of your life’s range.

	<h2>Through Dark Skies</h2>
	<p>In the beginning you were born without knowing strife. Through everything you came to see the corruption in everyday life. People are dead, homeless, and depressed on the streets while the rich are safe, happy, and fat in their beds lined with expensive sheets. They care not for those less fortunate than they while there are people plotting to make them pay. With guns, poison, and dark threats those wishing to tear the high horses to the ground, any means required they will fight every round. Darks skies overcast the planet with the hate made by those people, they care not for those that pass by never willing to consider their atrocities, knowing their actions do not make them shy
	<br><br>While they play what they think is the hero, they are shown being anything other. For their actions can make them seem evil to the good people they once where they now smother. There are those who see the error of their ways, but their actions stay causing them to go into a daze. We see so many stories of good guys and bad, never do we ask for both sides of the story which makes many sad. Though there are many who do not deserve it, there is a chance. Through the dark skies, a silver lining peeks through even if it's just a glance.</p>
